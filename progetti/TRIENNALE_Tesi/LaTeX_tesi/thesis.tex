\section*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent This work has been made possible thanks to Andrea Giura, the first to embrace my unconventional ideas and have faith in my ability to bring this project to life.
\vspace{10pt}

\noindent I am deeply grateful to Prof.ssa Domenica Scarano for her invaluable guidance throughout this incredible journey.
\vspace{10pt}

\noindent Heartfelt thanks also go to the wonderful people at INRiM who supported me and made me feel part of a team. Special appreciation is to Dr. Luigi Ribotta for teaching me how to correctly approach such a difficult job and for helping me to express myself, to Jessica Petiti for helping me improve my hands-on skills in the lab, and to Sabrina Caria, whose constant positivity brightened the office.
\vspace{10pt}

\noindent I would also like to thank Francesca Capellino, who supported me over the past three years and kept me focused on my studies. Without her, I might still be preparing for some exams.
