                With a significant role in material sciences, physics, (soft matter) chemistry, and biology, the transmission electron microscope is one of the most widely applied structural analysis tool to date. It has the power to visualize almost everything from the micrometer to the angstrom scale. Technical developments keep opening doors to new fields of research by improving aspects such as sample preservation, detector performance, computational power, and workflow automation. For more than half a century, and continuing into the future, electron microscopy has been, and is, a cornerstone methodology in science. Herein, the technical considerations of imaging with electrons in terms of optics, technology, samples and processing, and targeted soft materials are summarized. Furthermore, recent advances and their potential for application to soft matter chemistry are highlighted.},

	abstract = {MoS2/TiO2-based nanostructures have attracted extensive attention due to their high performance in many fields, including photocatalysis. In this contribution, MoS2 nanostructures were prepared via an in situ bottom-up approach at the surface of shape-controlled TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 nanosheets and bipyramids). Furthermore, a multi-technique approach by combining electron microscopy and spectroscopic methods was employed. More in detail, the morphology/structure and vibrational/optical properties of MoS2 slabs on TiO2 anatase bipyramidal nanoparticles, mainly exposing \{101\} facets, and on TiO2 anatase nanosheets exposing both \{001\} and \{101\} facets, still covered by MoS2, were compared. It was shown that unlike other widely used methods, the bottom-up approach enabled the atomic-level growth of well-defined MoS2 slabs on TiO2 nanostructures, thus aiming to achieve the most effective chemical interactions. In this regard, two kinds of synergistic heterojunctions, namely, crystal face heterojunctions between anatase TiO2 coexposed \{101\} and \{001\} facets and semiconductor heterojunctions between MoS2 and anatase TiO2 nanostructures, were considered to play a role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity, together with a proper ratio of (101), (001) coexposed surfaces.},

abstract = {Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals with dimensions below 100.0 nm exhibit a high crystal growth polymorphic behaviour in at least three distinct phases anatase, rutile and brookite. The phase composition and structural differences of these TiO2 polymorphs profoundly influence their physicochemical properties, leading to variations in performance for various applications. Particular emphasis is placed on quantifying the structure-property relationships that govern the distinct behaviours of anatase (bandgap ∼3.20 eV), rutile (bandgap ∼3.0 eV) and brookite (bandgap ∼3.4 eV) nanocrystals which exhibit variations in photocatalytic activity. This review provides a comprehensive crystallographic analysis of the polymorphic phases of TiO2 nanocrystals, focusing on their structural characteristics, phase transitions and stability. Crystalline TiO2 phases show anatase (101), brookite (121) and rutile (110) diffraction and anatase and rutile are tetragonal, while brookite shows an orthorhombic structure. The review provides a systematic compilation of the phase biographs of TiO2 polymorphs at the nanoscale through a detailed examination of X-ray diffraction patterns, electron microscopy images, and spectroscopic data. The effects of synthesis conditions such as temperature, precursors, and additives, on the phase composition and structural evolution are thoroughly discussed. Overall, this review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the crystallographic phase biographs of TiO2 polymorphs at the nanoscale, paving the way for the rational design of high-performance TiO2-based materials with tailored properties for diverse applications.}
