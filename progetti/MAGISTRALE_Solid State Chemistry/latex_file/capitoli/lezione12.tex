\subsection{[$\checkmark$] EPR Spectroscopy}

Bruh, you can study defects in crystal and of short-live species. It's used to study catalytic centers and reaction intermediates, focused more on the yield of the method. \textit{Long discussion about the spin.}

\subsubsection{Abbiocco}

Explanation on why we see the derivative of the signal and not the signal (based on the sampling we see only how much it changes, not the real value).
