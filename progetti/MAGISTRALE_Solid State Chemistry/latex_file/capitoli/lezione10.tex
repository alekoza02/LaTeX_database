\subsection{[$\checkmark$] Defects}

It's impossible to find a perfect crystal at a $T \neq 0^{\circ}K$

\vspace{10pt}

\noindent There are different types of defects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Frenkel defect
    \item Schottky defect
\end{itemize}

The entalpy of formation depend on the number of ions (+++ ++ +) and on the radius of the ion. Plus Schottky defects require more entalpy energy. 

\paragraph{Color centers influence the electric conductivity:} \textit{Trappole colore.} They can be detected with UV-Vis spectroscopy
