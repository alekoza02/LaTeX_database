\subsection{[$\checkmark$] Sun and Solar Panels}

We'll be focusing on the Silicon - Inorganic Thin Films - PV (Perovskite) solar panels.

Remember that the LUMO level should be high enough for the current injection, while the HOMO has to be low enough to be replenished.

\paragraph{Organometallic Photosensitizers:} Oldest method for dyes, there's a research for finding a $Ru$-free metal complexes. We can have based on the ligants a heteroleptic and homoleptic compounds, where an $COOH$ group is the anchoring group, while long C chains are a better exchanger with the electrolytes.
