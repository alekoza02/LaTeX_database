\subsection{[$\checkmark$] Direct - Indirect gap}

\paragraph{Why Silicon increases its conducibility at higher T:} Beacuse the vibration of the lattice of the metal changes the gap, reducing the probability of getting exactly the energy needed to perform the jump. In semicondctors happens the same thing, but the amount of charge mobility increases much faster.
